This is a trivial JSON <-> ruby parsing lib

This lib will NOT instantiate classes / symbols / exec random ruby code

Floats are not handled

Input strings are encoded as is, and so may yield json that is not valid UTF-8 (eg binary input). Decoding with this lib will get the binary data back as it was. The decoded strings may have an invalid encoding (eg marked as UTF-8 but holding non-conforming bytes)
